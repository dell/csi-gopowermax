Feature: PMAX Client library
  As a developer of the PMAX CSI driver that uses the PMAX REST client library
  I want to test the client library methods
  So they are known to work and have a high test coverage.

  Scenario Outline: Authenticate test cases
    When I induce error <induced> 
    And I call authenticate with endpoint <endpoint> credentials <credentials> apiversion <apiversion>
    Then the error message contains <errormsg>

    Examples:
    | endpoint    | credentials    | apiversion     |induced          | errormsg                    |
    | "mockurl"   | "good"         |     "90"       | "none"          | "none"                      |
    | "mockurl"   | "bad"          |     "90"       | "none"          | "Unauthorized"              |

    | "mockurl"   | "good"         |     "90"       | "httpStatus500" | "Internal Error"            |
    | "mockurl"   | "good"         |     "91"       | "none"          | "none"                      |

Scenario Outline: Test cases for modifyMobility for volume
    Given a valid connection
    And I have an allowed list of <arrays>
